<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Book Recommendation System project! 📚 This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation system in R using collaborative filtering techniques. By analyzing user preferences and historical data, this system suggests books that users are likely to enjoy, fostering a personalized reading experience.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<p>The following technologies are used in this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R programming language</li>
  <li>RecommenderLab library for collaborative filtering</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>The Dataset we are using includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Books Dataset: Contains information about the books, such as Title, Author, Year of Publication, Publisher, and Category. These variables are used to code the content-based recommendation system.</li>
  <li>Users Dataset: Stores data related to user profiles and preferences.</li>
  <li>Ratings Dataset: Captures user ratings for different books, forming the basis for collaborative filtering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaborative Filtering Techniques</h2>

<p>In this project, we explore the following collaborative filtering techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User-Based Filtering: Recommending books based on similarities between users' preferences and ratings.</li>
  <li>Item-Based Filtering: Recommending books based on similarities between items. We suggest books to users based on the books they have already bought.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It's Done</h2>

<p>The Book Recommendation System is built using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean and preprocess the book rating dataset.</li>
      <li>Transform the data into a suitable format for collaborative filtering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>User-Based Filtering:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate similarities between users based on their book preferences.</li>
      <li>Identify similar users to generate personalized recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Item-Based Filtering:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate similarities between books based on their attributes.</li>
      <li>Suggest books to users based on the books they have already bought.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Content-Based Filtering:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize the book features, such as title, author, and category, to build a content-based recommendation system.</li>
      <li>Improve recommendation accuracy by considering the category variable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What I Learnt </h2>

<p>Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the concepts and techniques of collaborative filtering for recommendation systems.</li>
  <li>Preprocessing and cleaning datasets to prepare them for collaborative filtering analysis.</li>
  <li>Implementing user-based filtering and item-based filtering algorithms in R using the RecommenderLab library.</li>
  <li>Building a content-based recommendation system by leveraging book attributes such as title, author, and category.</li>
  <li>Improving recommendation accuracy by considering additional factors, such as the category variable.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the performance of recommendation systems using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision.</li>
  <li>Gaining insights into the strengths and limitations of different collaborative filtering techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p>By completing this project, I have developed a solid foundation in recommendation systems and equipped with practical knowledge to apply these techniques in various domains.</p>
